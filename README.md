### Reforger Mod
# GRAD DoorLock

* Allows for players and GM to lock building doors
* First entity to interact with door becomes owner. All entities of same side can use the lock from thereon.
* Lock unlocks ability to open door


# Current Limitations/WIP
* its possible to lock on opened state
* there is no fallback/abuse prevention to locking someone inside a house (will probably be solved by allowing everyone inside house to unlock)
* GM can only lock and not open from GM interface
